# TFTPclient
A simple client for the TFTP protocol.

## How to use it

There are two ways to start the client :

- Modify the [Main](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/TFTPclient/blob/master/src/com/tftpclient/Main.java) class as you wish or juste use the ReceiveFile / SendFile methods
(see [ClientTFTP](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/TFTPclient/blob/master/src/com/tftpclient/TFTPClient.java) )
- Use [the basic GUI](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/TFTPclient/blob/master/src/com/tftpclient/GUITFTP.java)   

Important note : because no TFTP server is included in this project, you will need a TFTP server on localhost.
As I used it to test this application, I recommend [Pumpkin](http://kin.klever.net/pumpkin#.XuDWvUUzaUk).
